# Casino-Game
Project for my C Programming class

Programmed fully in C, all my own work.

The objective of this project was to make a casino simulator. You are given $500 to spend and can choose how much money you want to bet. You are given the choice between Blackjack and Slots. When playing Blackjack for the first time, you are asked how much to bet and how many decks to play with. When the card count goes under 10, the cards are shuffled. Upon completing the game, players are asked if they want to play the same game, play slots, or quit. If they choose to play blackjack, they will be asked if they would like to reshuffle the deck. If the bet amount is 0 or less, the game ends. If the player chooses to change the game, slots will begin. The player is given the choice of how much they want to bet, then the slots game begins. They are asked if they want to keep playing, change the game, or quit. Similarly, if the player runs out of money, the game ends. Once the player quits, the results are logged on a text file.

I believe I was fully capable of accomplishing the task ahead of me when it was assigned. I knew it would be difficult, but I had the tools to do it. One thing I was having a hard time with before starting the project was when to use pointers and when to use global variables. After this project, I believe I understand when it is valuable to use either one. Global variables are generally easier to use, but pointers allow a much deeper level of control. For this project, I decided it was best for me to use global variables, as there was little reason for me to not have variables global, though there are many cases where this may be a must. Two new things I learned throughout this project were the Beep function and the random functions. It was interesting learning how to use these new functions and is something I can see myself using in the future. An important skill I developed throughout this project was using clean pseudocode and being able to manage a large project. Initially, the scale of the project was daunting, but the pseudocode helped clear everything up. I just needed to begin at one part of the pseudocode and follow the lines, keeping a level head. I thought the project was hard getting started, especially when I began using functions with pointers as inputs, but as I got more into the flow of it, I felt the project became much easier. All in all, this was a very valuable project to my programming education.
